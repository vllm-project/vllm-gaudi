However, increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had, by 1983, dramatically reduced the profitability of this market. The growing success of the IBM personal computer, based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore (CEO since 1975) to shift the companys focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model. Moores decision to sole-source Intels 386 chip played into the companys continuing success.",

Other than that, I was free to loaf on the couch from morning to night, which is what I did. Around 8:00, I decided to shower before I left the house. Now, I have short hair that dries pretty quickly, but I am deeply vain about it, so I always dry it with the hairdryer right after I shower to ensure my hair doesnt get flat and weird. I never skip this step. So, I get out of the shower, start drying my hair... And then I wake up in bed. Its half an hour later. I feel like garbage, my entire body mysteriously hurts, and I am slowly realizing that I dont remember exiting the bathroom. My only clear thought is: oh shit, its 9:00! I have to pick up my girlfriend! Better shake myself awake. I dragged my aching carcass back to the bathroom, and this was when I noticed the massive blisters forming all over my hand. I was still pretty out of it, but I knew that this was a hospital visit kind of burn. My girlfriend then called to check in because I was running late and, despite my undoubtedly convincing argument that I was still perfectly fine to drive, she immediately knew something was wrong. She cabbed home and we got a ride to the ER. Turns out, I had my first ever seizure! It seems like during the seizure, I clenched the hairdryer in my fist and had it pointed at my other hand long enough to thoroughly cook it. The tissue loss is pretty deep in some areas and there was concerns about me retaining my mobility, but its been healing well so far.",
