# Quick Start Guide

vLLM Hardware Plugin for Intel® Gaudi® offers ready-to-run container
images that package vLLM together with the Intel Gaudi software. This
enables a fast and simple launch of the plugin using prebuilt Docker
images and Docker Compose, with support for custom runtime parameters and
benchmarking.

Detailed Quick Start procedures are available in the `docs` folder:
- [Basic Quick Start Guide](../docs/getting_started/quickstart/quickstart.md)
- [Advanced Configuration Options](../docs/getting_started/quickstart/quickstart_configuration.md)
- [Executing Inference](../docs/getting_started/quickstart/quickstart_inference.md)

If you prefer to build vLLM Hardware Plugin for Intel Gaudi from source or with a custom
Dockerfile, refer to the [Installation](../docs/getting_started/installation.md) guide.
