# Configuration

The `calibrate_model.sh` script automatically generates appropriate configuration files for the calibration process. However, if you require advanced customization, you can use JSON configuration files to control aspects like scale calculation methods, module selection, and performance optimizations. The `quantization_config` directory contains JSON templates that you can use directly or modify to suit your specific requirements. For more information, see the [Configuration](../../docs/configuration/calibration/calibration.md#configuration) chapter in the Calibration guide.
