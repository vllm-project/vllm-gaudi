# Supported Features

This document summarizes the features currently supported by the vLLM Hardware Plugin for Intel® Gaudi®, lists the features planned for future releases, and outlines the discontinued features with explanations for their deprecation.

## Supported Features

| **Feature**   | **Description**   | **References**  |
|---    |---    |---    |
| Offline batched inference     | Supports offline inference using the LLM class from vLLM Python API.    | [Quickstart](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/getting_started/quickstart.html#offline-batched-inference), [Example](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/examples/offline_inference/batch_llm_inference.html)   |
| Online inference via the OpenAI-Compatible Server     | Supports online inference through an HTTP server that implements the OpenAI Chat and Completions API.    | [Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/serving/openai_compatible_server.html), [Example](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/serving/openai_compatible_server.html)    |
| HPU autodetection     | Enables automatic target platform detection for HPU users at vLLM startup.     | N/A   |
| Paged KV cache with algorithms enabled for Intel® Gaudi® accelerators   | Provides a custom paged attention and cache operators implementations optimized for Intel® Gaudi® devices.   | N/A   |
| Custom Intel® Gaudi® operator implementations   | Provides optimized implementations of operators, such as prefill attention, Root Mean Square Layer Normalization, and Rotary Positional Encoding.     | N/A   |
| Tensor parallel inference      | Supports multi-HPU inference with tensor parallelism and multiprocessing.  | [Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/serving/distributed_serving.html), [HCCL reference](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/API_Reference_Guides/HCCL_APIs/index.html)    |
| Pipeline parallel inference    | Supports multi-HPU inference with pipeline parallelism.   | [Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/serving/distributed_serving.html), [Running Pipeline Parallelism](https://vllm-gaudi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/pipeline_parallelism.html)   |
| Inference with HPU Graphs     | Reduces host overheads by using HPU Graphs, which record execution graphs ahead of time and replay them during inference.  | [Documentation](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/Inference_on_PyTorch/Inference_Using_HPU_Graphs.html), [Optimization guide](../configuration/optimization.html)    |
| Inference with `torch.compile`   | Supports inference with `torch.compile`, which is the default setting for HPU.    | [vLLM HPU backend execution modes](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/getting_started/gaudi-installation.html#execution-modes)    |
| INC quantization  | Supports the FP8 model, KV cache quantization, and calibration with Intel Neural Compressor (INC). This feature is not fully supported with the `torch.compile` execution mode.    | [Documentation](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/Inference_on_PyTorch/Inference_Using_FP8.html)   |
| AutoAWQ quantization | Supports inference with models quantized using the AutoAWQ library. | [Library](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ) |
| AutoGPTQ quantization | Supports inference with models quantized using the AutoGPTQ library. | [Library](https://github.com/AutoGPTQ/AutoGPTQ) |
| LoRA/MultiLoRA support    | Supports LoRA and MultiLoRA on compatible models.     | [Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/models/lora.html), [Example](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/examples/offline_inference/multilora_inference.html), [vLLM supported models](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html)   |
| Fully async model executor     | Allows the model runner to run asynchronously with async scheduling, overlapping CPU operations , including `prepare_inputs`, and the model forward pass. It does not support speculative decoding, PP, or guided decoding. Expected speedup is 5-10% over the current async scheduling.   | [Feature description](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/23569)   |
| Automatic prefix caching   | Improves prefills efficiency. This feature is enabled by default.  | [Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/automatic_prefix_caching/apc.html), [Details](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/automatic_prefix_caching/details.html)  |
| Speculative decoding (functional release)     | Supports experimental speculative decoding, which improves inter-token latency in some scenarios. The feature is configurable via the standard `--speculative_model` and `--num_speculative_tokens` parameters. It is not fully supported with the `torch.compile` execution mode.   | [Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/models/spec_decode.html), [Example](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/examples/offline_inference/spec_decode.html)  |
| Multiprocessing backend   | The default distributed runtime in vLLM.   | [Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/distributed_serving.html)  |
| Multimodal   | Supports inference for multi-modal models. It is not fully supported with the `t.compile` execution mode. |  [Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/multimodal_inputs.html) |
| Guided decode   | Supports a guided decoding backend for generating structured outputs.   | [Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/structured_outputs.html)  |
| Exponential bucketing | Supports exponential bucketing spacing instead of linear spacing, automating the configuration of the bucketing mechanism. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled via `VLLM_EXPONENTIAL_BUCKETING=false` environment variable.   | N/A |
| Data Parallel support | Replicates model weights across multiple instances or GPUs to process independent request batches. | [Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/serving/data_parallel_deployment.html), [Example](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/examples/offline_inference/data_parallel.html)  |
